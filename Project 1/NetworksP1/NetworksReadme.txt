README:

Port: 5007

Run the chatd.java file and then run as many clientGUIs as you want. (java chatd -port 5007)
Client does not run, only the clientGUI.  

The gui accepts a username in the CYAN box.  after you enter one press login.

Then the CYAN box can be typed in to send messages

Group messaging is working

Private messaging I had done but screwed up so I did not submit it
many messages can be sent in a row however, and they won't be interupted

/help and /logout are implemented
/chat is partially implemented where you can pick a user but the private chat isn't working.
